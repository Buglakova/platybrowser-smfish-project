Update the prospr registration.

The new registration is still based on DAPI vs EM nucleus segmentation, but compared to the previous version (0.5.4),
the nuclei used for EM registration were filtered differently; they were filtered manually by Hernando Martinez,
because in the previous version we filtered out to many nuclei, which degraded registration quality in some areas.
