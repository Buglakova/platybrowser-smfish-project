Scripts to calculate parameters for intensity correction
master_intensity.py is the main script - it produces graphs of the median / 5% quantile range before correction
(as well as tables of this data), then applies various corrections & produces graphs/tables/images after correction.

The final correction used in the paper is 'platy_in_5_quantile_average_ends_724', with the calculated parameters being saved
in that folder as 'new_vals.csv'
